# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a machine-learning pipeline to predict rainfall using meteorological data.

**Contents**
- `Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` - Main notebook with data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Rainfall.csv` - Dataset used by the notebook (place in the same directory as the notebook).
- `rainfall_prediction_model.pkl` - (optional) serialized trained model produced by the notebook.

**Setup**
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install required packages:

```powershell
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
```

(Optionally create a `requirements.txt` with these packages.)

**Run the notebook**
1. Ensure `Rainfall.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook/Lab:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` and run the cells in order. If you see a `NameError: name 'pd' is not defined`, run the first import cell (the one that imports `pandas as pd`, etc.) before running the data-loading cell.

**Notes & Troubleshooting**
- If `pd.read_csv("Rainfall.csv")` raises `FileNotFoundError`, confirm that `Rainfall.csv` is in the same directory and that the notebook's working directory is the project folder.
- If imports fail, install the missing package(s) with `pip install <package>`.

**What I changed / why**
- Use a relative path for the dataset in the notebook (`Rainfall.csv`) so the notebook can load the file from the project directory.
- Fixed a small typo in the notebook comment.

**Next steps (suggested)**
- Add `requirements.txt` to pin package versions.
- Add a brief model card describing performance metrics and features used.
